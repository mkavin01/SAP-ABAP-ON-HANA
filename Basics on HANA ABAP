SAP - HANA -> System Applications and Products in Data Processing -> High performance ANalytic Appliance

HANA is a high performance, column oriented, in memory and relational database management system.

RDBMS           -> maintain relationship between data and store them in row and column.
In Memory       -> uses main memory so will be faster unlike traditional database
                -> in traditional database the ram will be limited hence there will be a constant swapping of data between 
                   appli. layer and db layer
                 ->bottle neck - slow I/O 

Column oriented -> data will be stored in column unlike rows in traditional database so will be faster by giving the
                  exact column data that matches the user query

ecc  -> data to code -> fetches data from database layer to application layer then do validations and filters
hana -> code to data -> fetches data from database layer to application layer post validations and filters in db layer
