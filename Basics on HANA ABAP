SAP - HANA -> System Applications and Products in Data Processing -> High performance ANalytic Appliance

HANA is a high performance, column oriented, in memory and relational database management system.
 
RDBMS           -> maintain relationship between data and store them in row and column.
In Memory       -> uses main memory so will be faster unlike traditional database
                -> in traditional database the ram will be limited hence there will be a constant swapping of data between 
                   appli. layer and db layer
                 ->bottle neck - slow I/O 
but keeping data in main memory might be costlier in real time. So HANA comes up with "Dynamic tiering"

Dynamic Tiering -> Most frequently used data will be stored in main memory "Hot Data"
                -> Less frequently accessed data will stored in disk "Warm Data" - persistent layer

OLTP -> Online Transaction Processing -> Row store table      Eg, ecc or R3 system
       Operation supported -> read wirte update modify
OLAP -> Online Analytical   Processing -> column store table  Eg, BW (Business Warehouse)
     Operation supoorted -> read 

HANA supports both OLTP AND OLAP -> HTAP ( Hybrid Transaction / Analytical processing )


Column oriented -> data will be stored in column unlike rows in traditional database so will be faster by giving the
                  exact column data that matches the user query

ecc  -> data to code -> fetches data from database layer to application layer then do validations and filters
hana -> code to data -> fetches data from database layer to application layer post validations and filters in db layer
