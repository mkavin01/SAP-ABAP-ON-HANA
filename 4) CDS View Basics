To retrive content from your db you need sql ( Structured Query Language )

SQL consits of three sub languages:

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)   - Used to create database objects - create table, create view, alter table,drop table
2) DML (Data Manipulation Language) - Used to create/edit content for the db objects - Select, insert, update and Delete
3) DCL (Data Control Language)      - used for data integrity and data security - Grant and Revoke

Classical Open SQL : SQL created for/ on top of ABAP language which supports only DML.

We have multiple limitations in Opem SQL :
1) No Right Outer Join
2) No Union
3) No sub queries in select 
4) no case statement
5) Could not use for SAP HANA features


To Over come the above limitation we have "New Open SQL" ( Available in NETWEAVER Version >= 7.40)

Classical Open SQL Example : 

SELECT matnr
       ernam
       bistm
       from  MARA
       into table l_i_mara
       where matnr in s_matnr.   ( Assumtion : l_i_mara is an standard internal table decalred already 
                                 and s_matnr is a select option)

New Open SQL Example :

SELECT matnr,
       ernam,
       bistm
       from  MARA
       into table @l_i_mara
       where matnr eq @lv_mara. ( Here @ Operator ensure those are dynamically defined at the time of run time)
