1) keep the result set small -> use having and where conditions whereever required
2) Minimize the amount of data transferred  -> use select fields not select *
3) Minimize the number of database accessing -> use joins and sub queries instead of nested select loop
4) Minimize search overhead -> use indexes
5) reduce the database load -> use table buffer if applicable and sort data in abap program


Also you have other aspects like code optimization techniques:

1) Avoid using Nested Loop. Still needed try using Parallel cursor technique.
2) Use empty range table for non used primary key in your query
3) Use data elements instead of using table name followed by field eg., Mara-matnr
4) Prefer using binary statement wherever applicable. Make sure you sort your table before using binary search.
5) Write the field in the same sequence as like your db table.
6) Do code inspector and SLIN for all your development.
7) Try using transporting no fields where ever applicable in your read table statement.


Evolution of Hard Coding.
-> used where ever required in your program
-> declared in top inculde and later used where ever need
-> declared in text elemet OR SO10 and then used 
-> Used in TVARVC and used later ( This approach will ensure dynamic handling of those objects )
-> Used in BRF+ ( This is the most effective approach since no need of maintainance from SAP Consultants unlike TVARVC 
                 this can be maintained by Business user itself ).

Refer., BRF + Notes for detailed explanation  on that
